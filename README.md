#QStudio [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vontell/qstudio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vontell/qstudio) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/vontell/qstudio/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/vontell/qstudio?branch=master)

QStudio is a project that has two primary goals:

1. Build a website with resources for developers who want to develop software for quantum computers. In as little as five years, it is possible that an average software developer will want to begin developing for quantum computers. It is essential that these developers have the ability to use quantum computers, even without a formal background in quantum physics and the math that goes along with it (much like how classical software developers rarely need a formal background in the concepts of classical physics and electromagnetism to write a piece of software).

2. Create a tool suite and IDE for developing software for quantum computers and running quantum information processing experiments and simulations.
