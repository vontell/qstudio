<md-divider></md-divider>

<p class="">Shor's algorithm is one of the most interesting quantum algorithms out there, helping jumpstart the interest of computer scientists, mathematicians, and physicists in the area of quantum algorithms. Created by Peter Shor in 1994 while working at AT&amp;T, it solves the problem of finding the prime factors of an integer \(N\).</p>
